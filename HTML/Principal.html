				<p>This is a <b>CPU</b>, also known as a <b>Central Processing Unit</b>, and its main function in a computer is to handle most of the processing tasks. It's often referred to as the <i>"brain"</i> of the computer as it performs everything to do with logical operations and instructions to run software by interpreting commands from programs.<br><br>
					A CPU is made up of several key components: an <b>arithmetic logic unit (ALU)</b> that performs all the logical operations and calculations, a <b>control unit (CU)</b> that manages how data flows through the CPU and instructs other components on the computer what to do, and <b>registers</b>, which are small, fast storage locations in the CPU that hold data and instructions that the CPU is using or working on actively.<br><br>
					The CPU operates in cycles known as the <i><b>fetch-decode-execute</b></i> cycle. This cycle consists of three steps: first, the CPU fetches an instruction from the computer's memory; next, it decodes the instruction to determine what action is required; and finally, it executes the action.<br><br>
					CPU performance is often measured in <b>gigahertz (GHz)</b>, which indicates the number of cycles it can complete per second. Many modern CPUs have multiple <i>cores</i>, essentially acting like separate processing units within a single CPU. Having more cores enables the CPU to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, improving multitasking and overall performance.

				<p>A motherboard is the <b>main circuit board</b> in the computer, which serves as a <b>central hub</b> where all components connect and communicate with each other. It is one of the <i>essential parts of a PC</i> because it links the computer's core components, allowing them to function together smoothly.<br><br> 
					The key functions of a motherboard include <b>component integration</b>, which is the connection of the <i>CPU, RAM, storage devices, GPU, and more</i>. Additionally, it <b>distributes power</b> from the power supply to parts of the computer. Furthermore, it manages and <b>coordinates the data flow</b> between the parts of the PC. Finally, the motherboard includes <b>expansion slots</b> where you can add extra parts to your computer, allowing for <i>customization and upgrades.</i><br><br> 
					The main components on a motherboard include the <b>CPU socket</b> (for the processor), <b>RAM</b> slots, <b>chipset</b> (controls data flow), <b>expansion slots</b> (for additional cards), <b>storage connectors</b> (for SSDs and HDDs), <b>BIOS/UEFI</b> (boot firmware), <b>power connectors</b>, and <b>peripheral ports</b> (USB, audio, Ethernet, etc.).<br><br>
					Motherboards come in <b>different sizes</b>, which determine the layout and <b>number of components they can support</b>. The choice of a motherboard depends on compatibility with the CPU and the amount of RAM.

				<p>A graphics card, or <b><i>GPU</i> (Graphics Processing Unit)</b>, is a critical hardware component that the computer uses to <b>render images, video, and animations.</b> It processes data from the <i>CPU</i> and translates it into visual information displayed on the monitor, making it <b>essential for high-quality visuals</b> in activities like gaming, video editing, 3D rendering, and graphic design.<br><br> 
					The <b>primary</b> functions of a GPU include rendering images quickly and accurately, offloading graphic-intensive tasks from the <i>CPU</i> to improve system performance, and <b>supporting high resolutions</b> and refresh rates for smooth visuals and detailed textures in high-fidelity applications.<br><br>
					There are <b>two main types</b> of graphics cards. First, <b>integrated graphics</b> are built <b>directly into the <i>CPU</i></b> and are suitable for everyday tasks like web browsing, watching videos, and basic office applications. Then, there are <b>dedicated graphics cards</b>, which are separate cards installed on the motherboard. These provide significantly more power than integrated graphics and are <b>ideal for graphics-intensive tasks</b> like gaming, video editing, and 3D rendering, as well as other demanding applications.<br><br>
					Modern graphics cards come with <b>advanced features</b> such as <b>ray tracing</b>, which allows for more realistic lighting and shadows in games, and <b>AI-driven enhancements</b> that improve visual quality and performance. These features make <b>modern GPUs a crucial part of high-performance PCs</b>, enhancing both the quality and realism of visual experiences.
