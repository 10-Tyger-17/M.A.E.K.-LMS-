            <p>This is a <b>CPU</b>, also known as a <b>Central Processing Unit</b>, and its main function in a computer is to handle most of the processing tasks. It's often referred to as the <i>"brain"</i> of the computer as it performs everything to do with logical operations and instructions to run software by interpreting commands from programs.<br><br>
                A CPU is made up of several key components: an <b>arithmetic logic unit (ALU)</b> that performs all the logical operations and calculations, a <b>control unit (CU)</b> that manages how data flows through the CPU and instructs other components on the computer what to do, and <b>registers</b>, which are small, fast storage locations in the CPU that hold data and instructions that the CPU is using or working on actively.<br><br>
                The CPU operates in cycles known as the <i><b>fetch-decode-execute</b></i> cycle. This cycle consists of three steps: first, the CPU fetches an instruction from the computer's memory; next, it decodes the instruction to determine what action is required; and finally, it executes the action.<br><br>
                CPU performance is often measured in <b>gigahertz (GHz)</b>, which indicates the number of cycles it can complete per second. Many modern CPUs have multiple <i>cores</i>, essentially acting like separate processing units within a single CPU. Having more cores enables the CPU to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, improving multitasking and overall performance.
